# How to Create Pivot Table in Excel

## Overview
A pivot table is a tool in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets and many more. With the use of it, organising extensive chunks of data will be more convenient. Here's the basic procedure on how to make a pivot table in Microsoft Excel:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data
  
Before creating a pivot table, prepare your datasheet by ensuring the headers are complete and there are no empty rows or columns.

### Step 2: Insert a Pivot Table

Click anywhere within the data range, go to the "Insert" tab, and then select "Pivot Table". This is to highlight your pivot table.

### Step 3: Configure Your Pivot Table

After clicking "Pivot Table", a dialogue will appear with several selections:

</center>

- Under "Select a table of range", the range of your table is already generated; don't change a thing.
- Under "Choose where you want the PivotTable to be placed", click on "New worksheet", then click "OK". 


### Step 4: Design Your Pivot Table

When done with the configuration, a new sheet will be generated with the "PivotTable Fields" on the right side.

You can drag and drop the fields in specific areas:

- Filters - filters data depending on the criteria.
- Columns - gives column-oriented perspective.
- Rows - gives row-oriented views.
- Values - calculates and counts data.

### Step 5: Customize Your Pivot Table

You can customise and adjust your pivot by right-clicking a specific element. You can choose whether to sort, format, or add/remove subtotals of your selected piece as required.

- Sort - reorganizing items into a specific order.
- Filters - setting a condition on what to display on the table.


### Step 6: Analyze Your Data

The pivot table is set. You may start analysing and adding visualisations, such as charts or diagrams, by clicking "PivotTable Analyze" and "PivotChart".
