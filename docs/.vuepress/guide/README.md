# Overview

A PivotTable is a tool in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets and many more. It is an interactive way of dealing with your data. With the use of it, organizing extensive chunks of data will be a lot quicker since it will allow you to easily recognize trends, patterns, or comparisons on your data that will aid in critical business decisions in a company or organization. Learning how to make a PivotTable can be a bit intimidating at first, but with the proper guidance, it can be exciting, too.

- Under **Choose where you want the PivotTable to be placed**, click on **New worksheet**, then click **OK**. 


### Step 4: Design Your PivotTable

When done with the configuration, a new sheet will be generated with the **PivotTable Fields** on the right side.
